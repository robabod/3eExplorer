3eExplorer v0.1.0.2
=-----------------=


Introduction:
=============

3eExplorer is a utility for Windows to allow the examination and manipulation of
images of drives used by the +3e. The +3e, as developed by Garry Lancaster, is a
modification of the standard ROMs of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2a/+3 to allow
them to use large capacity storage interfaces in the same way as a normal 3"
floppy disc. There are several storage devices supported, including the DivIDE,
ZXCF, ZXATASP, with each device requiring a different set of ROMs. There are
additional alterations to the ROMs including bugfixes and "windowed" BASIC text
output. It's a really useful modification, and easy to implement (with only two
EPROMs).

Currently the +3e uses a custom format for the discs, PLUSIDEDOS, which allows
a single disk to be partitioned into several distinct areas conforming to the
theoretical +3DOS limit of a 32Mb partition size. Because of this it can be
tricky to swap files between the ZX Spectrum and a PC. This is where 3eExplorer
comes in. It allows you to open an HDF image file of a PLUSIDEDOS disk and
browse the files stored on it. Currently it is read-only, allowing you to
extract files from the image into a number of formats on your PC. Importing new
files is a planned addition. It is also planned to support more image-types such
as .dsk.

While the image file is opened read-only, it wouldn't hurt to back it up first.
This is a beta application after all.
